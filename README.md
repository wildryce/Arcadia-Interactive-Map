*This map is still a work in progress, and will include more features and information as it gets developed.*

## Map Info
This map is designed to help navigate the world of Arcadia, keeping track of what has been collected and what is still hidden in the world to claim.

The map features icons on the map to show where in the world collectibles, upgrades, and more are located.

## Features
With the map, you are able to click on any icon in the world, to mark it as either 'collected' or 'not collected' (which is visualized as the icon becoming translucent for collected, and opaque as not collected).

Along with this, any item groups can either been hidden or shown by clicking on one of the groups on the top-left legend panel. Don't need any more disruptors cleared out? Hide them! Looking for only specific pickups? Disable all but that! Use it however it is needed.
